# 3d Printed 5DOF robotic arm + Isaac-Simulator integration + inverse kinematics
A 3D-printed 5-DOF robotic manipulator designed, built, and simulated from scratch. The project combines mechanical design, inverse kinematics, and digital-twin simulation using NVIDIA Isaac Sim.

Key Features

Fully 3D-printed 5-DOF robotic arm

Designed in Fusion 360

Inverse Kinematics implementation (Python)

URDF model for simulation

Integrated with Isaac Sim for realistic physics and motion testing

Digital twin: same kinematics for simulation and real hardware
