# 3d Printed 5DOF robotic arm + Isaac-Simulator integration + inverse kinematics
A 3D-printed 5-DOF robotic manipulator designed, built, and simulated from scratch. The project combines mechanical design, inverse kinematics, and digital-twin simulation using NVIDIA Isaac Sim.

Key Features

1) Build on ESP32 and MG996R servos

2) Designed in Fusion 360

3) Inverse Kinematics implementation (Python ikpy library, ROS2)

4) URDF model for simulation

5) Integrated with Isaac Sim for realistic physics and motion testing

6) Digital twin: same kinematics for simulation and real hardware
